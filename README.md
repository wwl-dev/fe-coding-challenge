## Frontend Engineer - Coding Challenge

Create a React.js web application to showcase your frontend development and UI skills. You can start with this template (to save some time) or create your own (it's recommended to use the plugins stated below). Prioritize the labeled items in the design first and work your way to the rest of the details. (You are not expected to implement all the small details as long as the main functionality is working; it would be a bonus if you implement other small details).


We highly encourage to use the following modules to be used on top of React.js framework.

-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-container/)
-   [Styled components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled)
-   [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
